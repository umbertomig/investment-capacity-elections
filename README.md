> **Abstract**: The importance of money in elections is a hallmark of contemporary democracies. In this short article, we study how investment capacity, defined as the resources remaining after the municipality performs its mandatory expenditures, influences Brazil's elections. We theorize that when a politician wins the election, this generates commitment problems in low investment capacity municipalities, as new mayors cannot reward the firms that contributed to their campaigns. We test these claims by considering a close-elections regression discontinuity design coupled with heterogeneous quartile effects for Brazilian municipalities between 2000 and 2012. We find that incumbent mayors in towns with low investment capacity receive less campaign donation afterward and are more disadvantaged in their reelection contests. The results are robust to design variations and changes in party labels or mayoral characteristics. Our findings have implications for the influence of money on politics in democratic countries.
